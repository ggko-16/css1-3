                    This is the most recent theory explaining the origin and evolution of the universe. The Big Bang theory
                    suggests that the history of the universe began with the Big Bang around 13.8 billion years ago. As a
                    result of the Big Bang, time, space, and all matter were created, leading to the expansion of the cosmos.

                    String theory is one approach that seeks a unified description of the physical world. According to this theory, we live in a three-dimensional
                    space on Earth, but the cosmos might contain additional microscopic, non-material "strings" (vibrating filaments) that are part of confined
                    spaces with different sizes and characteristics.

                            explains all fundamental forces and particles in the universe, including gravity, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics.
